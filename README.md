## Inspiration
We were all inspired by our love for beans and FPS Gaming. We thought that if we put those two together we could make a very fun and interactive game.

## What it does
We incorporated different stages in which a bean tries to get to the end and survive. Each stage gets progressively harder by doing parkour and shooting.

## How we built it
We built it using the Unity Engine and C# scripting. 

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, Unity collaboration had changed over the past year so we had a lot of issues with version control with peer members. Linking the server to others was a first-timer and it took us hours to get started with everything. Programming the third-person design was a difficult challenge as Visual Studio became corrupted and we learned a lot of new techniques throughout the coding experience. We used ProBuilder, a geometric map design software that was new to most and we definitely gained a learning experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to each create multiple stages with interactive options. We were able to work harmonically as a team and provided help for each other when needed. Programming third-person controls with weaponry was not a simple task and it took up most of our time.

## What we learned
We learned great team-building and many new skills with the game SDK Unity. 

## What's next for Bean Shooters
We will implement various different challenges with both single and a possible new multiplayer platform where all the bean lovers can come together. There will be more weapons and different bean skins to choose from :)
